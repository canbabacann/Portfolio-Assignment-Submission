# Portfolio Assignment - C# Projects

This repository contains various projects and exercises related to C# and .NET development. Each project demonstrates different concepts such as object-oriented programming, interfaces, operator overloading, and polymorphism.

## Project Files

### 1. Polymorphism.cs
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in C#. The `Employee` class implements the `IQuittable` interface, which includes a `Quit()` method. In the main program, polymorphism is demonstrated by treating an `Employee` object as an `IQuittable` object and calling the `Quit()` method.
- **Key Concepts**: Polymorphism, Interfaces, and Method Overriding.

### 2. Operator Assignment.cs
- **Description**: This project focuses on operator overloading. The `Employee` class has overloaded `==` and `!=` operators to compare two `Employee` objects based on their `Id`. It also overrides the `Equals` and `GetHashCode` methods to ensure proper comparison behavior.
- **Key Concepts**: Operator Overloading, Overriding Methods.
- **Repository**: [Operators Assignment](https://github.com/canbabacann/Operators-Assignment-Submission)

### 3. Method Class Assignment
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the use of methods and classes in C#. It includes various examples of method creation, parameter passing, and class implementation.
- **Key Concepts**: Methods, Classes, Object-Oriented Programming.
- **Repository**: [Method Class Assignment](https://github.com/canbabacann/Method-Class-Assignment-Submission)

### 4. Final Assignment
- **Description**: This is the final assignment showcasing comprehensive C# skills, including advanced programming concepts and techniques learned throughout the course.
- **Key Concepts**: Advanced C# Programming, Project Structure, Best Practices.

### 5. ASP.NET MVC Entity Framework
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the implementation of ASP.NET MVC architecture with Entity Framework for database operations.
- **Key Concepts**: ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, Web Development.
- **Repository**: [ASP.NET MVC Entity Framework](https://github.com/canbabacann/ASP.NET-MVC-Entity-Framework)
